Fifteen minutes into the second session of the Butler Township zoning hearing to consider a solar installation, an unidentified member of the audience interrupted officials conducting the hearing, resulting in a recess and police being called Tuesday evening.
A question was raised about the view shed of the State Route 234 corridor as mentioned in a county comprehensive plan, when voices from the back of the audience in the Biglerville Fire Hall where the hearing is being conducted began interrupting officials.
The person interrupted the solicitor for the applicant, Formation Energy, Dean Reynosa, who was objecting to questions from a person who is a party to the proceedings.
Reynosa, rather than answer the line of questions, called “for decorum.” Butler Zoning Board Solicitor Adam Boyer called for all those present to “respect the structure of the meeting,” repeating the rules of who could address the zoning board.
Only a limited number of people were given status to be allowed to speak during the proceedings.
When the unidentified speaker continued to insult Reynosa and then interrupted Boyer, telling him to sit down, and continued his outbursts such as “This is phony,” the solicitor recessed the meeting, gathering board members in the rear of the fire hall.
Local law enforcement was called during the recess and minutes later, Biglerville Police Officer Joe David entered the room.
Police took no action, according to Biglerville Chief Craig Hartley.
Zoning Board Chair Thomas Walter called the meeting to order once again at 7 p.m. and the hearing resumed without further interruption.
